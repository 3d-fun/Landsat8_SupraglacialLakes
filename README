*** About ***
The scripts in this folder (using MATLAB 2014b & GDAL framework package 1.11) build on earlier lake depth analysis, applying them to a 2015 case study. How all of the scripts work together is documented in the workflow information (see below). Note that some MATLAB scripts (developed in 2014b) require the MATLAB Mapping Toolbox (Version 4.0.2) and the Optimization Toolbox (Version 7.1). In addition, some manual steps (see Workflow diagram) are carried out using QGIS (www.qgis.org)

*** Workflow Information ***
See workflow description in Pope 2016 (Earth and Space Science). Provenance diagram (SK15_provenance.pdf) also shared in this repository.

*** Folder Structure ***
The subfolders in this repository mirror the modular pieces of the workflow involved in the research process, namely:
*Depth: Taking Landsat 8 data and calculating lake depths, specifically for the case study are of this work (Sermeq Kujalleq / Jakobshavn area, Greenland)
*LakeAnalysis: Using the Band 4 & Band 8 average (identified as best in Validation) to investigate the behaviour of lake depths in the Jakobshavn region in summer 2015 - producing a histogram of depths and studying relative elevations on the ice sheet.
